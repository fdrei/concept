# ZENtrale - Concept sheet

## Concept
#### *This is the "what" section*

The basic concept behind **ZENtrale** is to consolidate different communication channels and associations into one single app.

Every email, chat message or calendar invitation (usually send by email) needs a place to come in. All these incoming messages are associated with a contact (known or unknown). **ZENtrale** provides, as it is named, an central place where all these incomes will be collected.

**ZENtrale** follows the "K.I.S.S." principals - **K**eep **I**t **S**imple and **S**tupid. Therefore the app is as reduced and intuitive as possible but inspired by other well-known applications and picks up common concepts just in a new way.

**ZENtrale** is not "yet another email / chat / calendar / contact app". It's not "the reinvention of the wheel". **ZENtrale** is about to unify all the well-known features in just a new way.

#### Features:

**ZENtrale** combines the following single applications:

* a basic **email** client
* an instant **messenger**
* a **calendar**
* **contact** management

## Benefits & Values
#### *This is the "why" section*

**ZENtrale** is about to bring/keep related items in one place to reduce application hopping. Less effort on this side increases productivity.

## Technology
#### *This is the "how" section*

**ZENtrale** is built with NodeJS + Node Webkit so it is a cross plattform application from the very beginning.
