## Technology

### The newcomer: node-webkit

**node.js website quote:**
> *node-webkit is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js. You can write native apps in HTML and JavaScript with node-webkit. It also lets you call node.js modules directly from the DOM and enables a new way of writing native applications with all Web technologies.*

### ... and the usual suspects

Zentrale comes with sleek and minimal UI. It is build with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. And that's all the secret behind the application and it's lightweight components.

### But the best is yet to come

The best thing about **Zentrale** is: it runs on almost every Desktop Operating System. No compatibility issues no need to develop for different platforms. Only one tech stack for all OSs.
